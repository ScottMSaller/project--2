## Recipe Boss - Recipe Search and Save Website


## Description
This interactive website gives users the ability to search for specific recipes, save recipes to their own personal page, and conveniently locate local grocery stores to complete their ingredients list and restock on that pesky garlic powder that you always seem to be out of.

## Visuals
*Need to Add*

## Installation
Within a particular ecosystem, there may be a common way of installing things, such as using Yarn, NuGet, or Homebrew. However, consider the possibility that whoever is reading your README is a novice and would like more guidance. Listing specific steps helps remove ambiguity and gets people to using your project as quickly as possible. If it only runs in a specific context like a particular programming language version or operating system or has dependencies that have to be installed manually, also add a Requirements subsection.

## Usage
As a user interested in cooking, I want a website that allows me to search/save recipes and locate local grocery stores in case I am in need of ingredients, so that I can easily access recipes for future cooking success.

## Support
You may contact Scott, Alex, or Tushar with any questions, comments, or concerns that may arise. 

## Roadmap
We are excited at the possibilities this website has to offer. 
Future Development may include but is not limited to:
- Personal ratings for recipes (difficulty level, time level, taste level)
- The MyRecipes page can be reorganized and searched by categories (type of cuisine, amount of time, difficulty level, etc.)
- A new search in which recipes can be crafted given a certain specific ingredients


## Contributing
This team welcomes suggestions, contributions, and constructive feedback in hopes to continuously improve this website.
