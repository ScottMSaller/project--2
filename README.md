## Usage
As a user interested in cooking, I want a website that allows me to search/save recipes and locate local grocery stores in case I am in need of ingredients, so that I can easily access recipes for future cooking success.

## Support
You may contact Scott, Alex, or Tushar with any questions, comments, or concerns that may arise. 

## Roadmap
We are excited at the possibilities this website has to offer. 
Future Development may include but is not limited to:
- Personal ratings for recipes (difficulty level, time level, taste level)
- The MyRecipes page can be reorganized and searched by categories (type of cuisine, amount of time, difficulty level, etc.)
- A new search in which recipes can be crafted given a certain specific ingredients
